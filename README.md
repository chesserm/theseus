# Theseus: Procedural Maze Generation and RL Solver

A simple side project to practice procedural generation and Reinforcement Learning.

This is implemented using [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [Stable Baselines 3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/).

The custom environment created in `maze_environment.py` is heavily based on [the starting example in the Gymnasium documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/environment_creation/).

# Usage

The project environment (including all Python packages) is managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Once you do, simply run `uv sync` to setup the environment. 

Then run the code with `uv run python3 -m src.main`.
